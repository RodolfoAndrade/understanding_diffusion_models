# understanding_diffusion_models

Together with Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) is a type of Deep Learning model part of the generative AI capable of generating new images. 

On this Jupyter Notebook file, I explain the basic principals used in Difussion models and show some results.

This Jupyter Notebook is derived from a notebook by deepfindr@gmail.com, their [notebook](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHZUU3UycnAyTmgwWks2QWVKZjROYjNfellaQXxBQ3Jtc0ttaEJkYXhIZGlqdlFEcEZIYmZxYTVqRTlVZ2ZyQldfM3ZTX2tBYzRyUXRwZUs2Y2pLTW15TlpTekZUYmdvd200eGprNk1oTkRMWlNrbGRDV1FLNklwNkxiOXJ0QU5iaFdsUFVaMm1LNlJ0US1EQmJvYw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fcolab.research.google.com%2Fdrive%2F1sjy9odlSSy0RBVgMTgP7s99NXsqglsUL%3Fusp%3Dsharing&v=a4Yfz2FxXiY) can be found in the description of their YouTube [video](https://youtu.be/a4Yfz2FxXiY?si=sRHWekx6D0esnGZJ) about DDPM and it helped me to better understand the logic behing the model and how it is capable of generating images. I recommend watching it.
